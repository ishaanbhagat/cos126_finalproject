We created a comprehensive GUI showing a customizable simulation of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
It is a useful visualization of Newton’s Law of Gravitational Motion, clients can customize the masses
 of the Sun and Earth (within preset reasonable bounds), play and pause the simulation to study it
 closer if needed, view a figure of the number of figurative Earth days passed since the simulation
 begun, use a toggle for customized background music, and use a reset button to set the simulation
 back to its original state at any time (eliminating a need to re-run the Java command). The
 simulation additionally provides a fun ‘Star Wars’ mode toggle to purely change the visual
 appearance of the simulation. We also provide toggles to display visualizations of the gravitational
 forces present, the Earth’s translational velocity and a white orbital trace of the Earth’s trajectory.
